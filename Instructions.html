 <h1 style = "float: left;">Step 1:</h1>
    <br><br><br>
    <p>Click on "Choose a file" button and import an audio file from your computer. You can only import .wav, .mp3, etc
    file extensions. After you have chosen a file, you should see the waveform and the spectrum of the signal.</p>
    <h1 style = "float: left;">Step 2:</h1>
    <br><br><br>
    <p>You can play, pause and stop the track by using the buttons. You can also adjust the volume by using the volume
    button. The third container shows you during playing the current time and the total length of the track. During
    playing you can see the progress bar of the signal in the waveform and in the spectrum. You can select with the mouse
    on the waveform just a part of the track, which you want to hear. By doing this, the spectrum will show you just
    that part. You can zoom in and out in the spectrum by using "Ctrl + mouse wheel" for the time axis and "Shift +
    mouse wheel" for the frequency axis.</p>
    <h1 style = "float: left;">Step 3:</h1>
    <br><br><br>
    <p>You can change the settings of the spectrum by choosing a block length, an overlap, a window type and a colormap.
    The default block length is 1024, the default window type is the hann window and the default overlap is 50%. The
    default type of the colormap is Parula, but you can choose between other 3 colormaps. For the spectrum you can
    choose a min and a max value for the visualization......... Depending on what you want to analyse you can choose the
    display type. You can visualise the spectrum, the phase, the modulation spectrum, the group delay and the
    instantaneous frequency of the signal.</p>
