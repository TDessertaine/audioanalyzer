    <p>This Website includes useful information about how to use the Audioanalyzer to analyse your audio file. In addition we tried to help the user by writing short tooltipps. If you need help to use the website you can navigate to the preferred help-section
        in the menu on the left side. The website is programmed by using the following technologies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>JavaScript ES6 (JS ES6)</li>
        <li>Plotly (JS-Framework)</li>
        <li>Rainbow (JS-Framework)</li>
        <li>MathJax (JS-Framework)</li>
        <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML5)</li>
        <li>Cascading Style Sheet (CSS3)</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="margin-top: 16px;">The audioprocessing is based on a free FFT programmed in JavaScript (JS) by Nayuki. For more information visit <a href="https://www.nayuki.io/page/free-small-fft-in-multiple-languages" target="_blank">www.nayuki.io</a>. The main goal we adressed was
        to create an easy and useful tool to analyse audio files in terms of magnitude, phase and other values which are displayable and interpretable as a spectrogram. The user is able to apply different settings for various examinations. For describing
        the different windows, we used <b>plotly.js</b> for illustration, <b>rainbow.js</b> to highlight the code and <b>mathJax.js</b> to write LateX formula in HTML5. We tried to describe all the parameters in an easy way in the instructions.</p>
    <h2><a id="choosingAFile">Choose a file:</a></h2>
    <figure>
        <img class="resizeImg" id="upload" src="image/upload.png">
        <figcaption>Figure 1: Upload the audio file which you want to analyse.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>If you click on “Choose a file” you are able to import an audio file from you local computer. You can analyse different audio formats e.g. wav or mp3.
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Supported_media_formats" target="_blank">(Click here for more audio formats)</a>. After you choose a file the waveform and the magintude-spectrum will be calculated and displayed below
        the buttons after the loading screen disappeared. The upload button now shows the name of your uploaded file. By clicking the button again, you can upload a new audio file. Your audio data won’t be saved at any point just analysed.</p>
    <h2><a id="controlBar">Control Bar:</a></h2>
    <figure>
        <img class="resizeImg" src="image/controlbar.png">
        <figcaption>Figure 2: Control bar to operate your sound in terms of play / stop for example.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>You can play, pause and stop your uploaded track by using the different buttons in the control bar. Here you also find the button "Choose a file" which was described in the section before. You can also adjust the volume by using the volume slider
        next to the stop button. The numbers display the current playback time and the total length of the track in MM:SS:m separated by a slash. You can use the pause and play button to control the playback signal while you analyse it. It is also possible
        to loop a selected part of the audio file by ticking the box next to "Loop". How to select a part of your audio file is explained in the Waveform section. In case of analysis you can pick a matching grid size for the waveform including small,
        medium and large.</p>
    <h2><a id="waveform">Waveform:</a></h2>
    <figure>
        <img class="resizeImg" src="image/waveform.png">
        <figcaption>Figure 3: A view of the waveform of an uploaded audio file.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The waveform is compound by the linear amplitude (blue) and the RMS (lightblue). The RMS is calculated by RMS $= \sqrt{\dfrac{1}{N}\sum \limits_{i=0}^{N} n_{i}^{2}}$. On the x-axis you have the time scale and on the y-axis you have .... In the upper
        left corner you can see a legend showing your current mouse position when you move over the waveform. The legend includes the time, amplitude and the RMS. When you pushhit play after uploading an audio file, a red line shows the current time point
        in the waveform. If you click into the waveform and drag your mouse backward or forward you can select a single part of the waveform. When you release the mouse button your selection is shaded in transparent red. If you now push the play button
        you just play the selected part. It is also possible to use the Loop to repeat the selected audio part.</p>
    <h2><a id="spectrogram">Spectrogram:</a></h2>
    <figure>
        <img class="resizeImg" src="image/spectrum.png">
        <figcaption>Figure 4: A view of the spectrum of an uploaded audio file.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The spectrogram has different display types which are discussed in a section below. One thing they have in common, they are always three dimensional. On the x-axis you have the time and on the y-axis you have the frequency. If you move your cursor
        over the spectrogram the position data is displayed in the upper left corner. To identify the 3th dimension you have a legend for the colormap over the spectrogram on the right side. If you want to have more information you can zoom into the spectrogram
        by pressing the buttons down in the right corner of the spectrum window. You can zoom both the time and the frequency axis. As you have read in the last section, it is possible to select a short piece of your audio file. When you do that in the
        waveform, the spectrogram will automatically zoom in the selected part of the audio file. </p>
    <h2><a id="parameters">Parameters:</a></h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">You can customize the spectrogram individually by choosing the following listing parameters:</p>

    <p>The default block length is 1024, the default window type is the hann window and the default overlap is 50%. The default type of the colormap is viridis, but you can choose between 4 colormaps. For the spectrum you can choose a minimal and a maximal
        value which zooms the spectrogram's value range. Depending on what you want to analyse you can choose between the four display types. The different display types (depending on the display type) are discussed in the section
        <b>Display-Types</b>.

    <h2><a id="blockLength">Block-Length:</a></h2>
    <p>The block length is the number of samples used to divide the audio signal into equal blocks. In our case the block length is equal to the FFT-size. This means one bit in the spectrogram represents one audio sample and defines the frequency resolution
        of the window. For a 44100 Hz sample rate and a block size of 1024, the signal is being divided into 512 frequency bins. Changing the block length affects the temporal resolution and the coefficient quality of the spectrum. If you increase the
        block size, you will have an improved frequency resolution, because you have more bins in the same plot resolution. An increase of the block size slows the calculation time.</p>
    <h2><a id="windowType">Window-Types:</a></h2>
    <p>The following part is adressed to the different window types. We tried to explain the windows in various ways, mathematically, graphically and in the way we programmed them in JavaScript. In general a window can be explained as a weight for the audio
        signal in the time domain. If you take a look at a window itself in the time domain as well as in the frequency domain, you can categorize a window in three major classes and subclasses in the frequency domain (Quelle AMT):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Spectral resolution</li>
        <ul>
            <li>-3 dB point</li>
            <li>Effective noise width</li>
            <li>Rippel factor</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Power of damping</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Damping of the first sidelobe</li>
            <li>Spectral roll-off</li>
            <li>$\Delta$f till damping &gt; 60dB</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Selectivity</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-top: 0px;">The following subsections explain each window more detailed. You see the mathematical definition of the window, a illustration and the implementation. For illustration we used the Framework <b>Plotly.js</b>. All windows are calculated with the default
        length of 1024. The input for the windows were calculated with a linespace function in JS. To link the math part and the code we have $N$ &#8793; windowLen.length and $n$ &#8793; windowLen[i].</p>

    <h2><a id="overlap">Overlap:</a></h2>
    <p>The images below tries to illustrate two different overlaps. When you select an overlap of 90% the calculation may take a little bit longer. The more percentage overlap you choose, the more sample blocks will be transformed from the time domain into
        the frequency domain. In terms of programming an overlap algorithm you define a so called <b>hopsize</b>, this means a number of samples you jump forward to get the new block. For example if you got a block size of 100 samples and an overlap of
        75% your hopsize results in $\frac{100}{4} = 25$. If you have calculated you hopsize correctly the next step is to calculate the total number of blocks for your audio data. The code below shows a way to calculate a hopsize form a given overlap
        and block length.</p>

    <h2><a id="displayType">Display-Types:</a></h2>
    <p>On the Audioanalyzer website you have different types of spectrograms we called <b>Display-Types</b>. All of them are based on a free FFT programmed in JavaScript (JS) by Nayuki. In this section you find a short description of the spectrograms and
        how they are implemented. To combine the programming with the mathematical theory we shortly wrote down the definition for each spectrogram. We just outlined the theory, for more information you have to search in several specialist books or on
        the internet.</p>
    <h3>1. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)</h3>
    <p>As already mentioned we have the basic FFT to transform the audio data from the time domain into the frequency domain. The FFT we used needs the real part and the imaginary part of the signal. In almost all cases of signals we have just the real part,
        because "real world signal" just have a real part. That is the reason why the imaginary part (var imag) is filled with zeros by the same length as the real part. In our case the FFT returns a real part and an imaginary part of the transformed signal.
        The Fast Fourier Transform is a fast version of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) which is defined as:</p>
    <p class="equation">$X(n) = X(e^{j2\pi n/N}) = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{N-1}x(k)e^{-j2\pi nk/N}$</p>
    <p>The inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) is defined as:</p>
    <p class="equation">$x(k) = \dfrac{1}{N}\sum\limits_{n=0}^{N-1}X(n)e^{j2\pi nk/N}$</p>
    <p>The FFT itself works with a power of two block size. For further information you can find explanations in several books of signal processing.</p>
    <h3>2. Spectrum</h3>
    <p>In the section <b>Block-Length</b> were some information about how to split an audio signal into blocks, depending on the block length. For a spectrum you need to transform every block of an audio signal from the time domain into frequency domain.
        After you transformed your audio signal blocks, you have to calculate the absolute value complex number. To calculate the absolute value of a complex number ($z = a + \text{i}b$) use the following equation:</p>
    <p class="equation">$|z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$</p>
    <p>If you look at the spectrum of your signal you will see three dimensions the time (x-axis), the color coded magnitude (calculated by the code below) and the frequency (y-axis). If we talk about the frequency you have to know about the Nyquist-Theorem.
        This theorem is very important when you work with time discrete or sampled data (e.g sampling rate $f_s = 44100$Hz). The Nyquist-Theorem implies that the maxium frequency ($f_{max}$) is limited by the half of the sampling rate.</p>
    <p class="equation">$f_{max} = \dfrac{f_s}{2}$</p>

    <h3>4. Group Delay</h3>
    <h3>5. Instantaneous Frequency Deviation (IFD)</h3>
    <h2><a id="colormap">Colormaps:</a></h2>
    <p>Colormaps are used to show the third dimension in the displayed time frequency plots like the classic spectrogram or the group delay. In the spectrogram for example, the colormap codes the amplitude of each frequency bin to each time.
      There are three differnet types of colormaps included in this page. </p>
      <h3>Linear or Sequential Colormaps</h3>
    <p> Linear or Sequential Colormaps are desined in a way, that the lightness value of the color increases or decreases in a linear manner through the whole colormap. Through this, the interpretation of graphics are steight forward.
      The lighter the color is, the higher is the value that the color is representing. The three linear colormaps that are part of the audioanalyzer are <b>viridis</b>, <b>plasma</b> and <b>gray</b>. They are only available for the spectrogram.</p>
