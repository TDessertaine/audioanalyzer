    <p>The Web audio analyser is a website made by students from the Jade Hochschule Oldenburg, department acoustic engineering. The team was build of three students interested in audio processing by the guidance of a project leader. The website is based
        on HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. All the functions used were self programmed. The FFT used for analysing the signals was taken from 2014 Project Nayuki with the MIT License. </p>
